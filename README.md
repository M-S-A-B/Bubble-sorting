Title:Bubble sorting

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: Bubble Sort Algorithm is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

Iteration in arrays is done using for loops.


Algorithm:

Start =>  declare and initialize an array => then sort the array using bubble sorting =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:
In this code we declare and initialize an array. Then sort the array using bubble sorting. Then print the bubble sorted array. Iteration in arrays is done using for loops.
